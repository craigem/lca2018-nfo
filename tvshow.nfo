Being held at the University of Technology, Sydney, linux.conf.au is the largest linux and open source conference in the Asia-Pacific region. Run annually since 1999, it brings together the Australian, New Zealand and international community for standout presentations, demonstrations and relationship building.

linux.conf.au is a conference where people gather to learn about the entire world of Free and Open Source Software, directly from the people who shape the projects and topics that theyâ€™re presenting on.

We aim to provide a deeply technical conference made up of industry leaders and experts on a wide range of subjects from the inner workings of the Linux kernel itself, to open source projects (hardware and software), to open data, to open government to community engagement.
