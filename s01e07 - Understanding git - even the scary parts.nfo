    Git is by far the most popular version control system used by developers today. However, some aspects of Git can be hard to grasp as a new developer. This talk is aimed at Git users and developers who would like to understand how Git works on a conceptual level, so they can use Git to its full potential without fear. Topics covered in this talk are:

    * A high level view of how Gitâ€™s storage works
    * What is a branch
    * Git merge and Git rebase - and when to use (and not use) them
    * Git Vs. repository management services like Gitlab and Github
